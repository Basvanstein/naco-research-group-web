    <h2>Welcome to the Natural Computing Cluster</h2>
    <p>
        At the <strong>Natural Computing Cluster</strong>, LIACS, University Leiden, we delve into the fascinating world where natural phenomena intersect with computational algorithms. 
        Our team of dedicated senior researchers and PhD students is committed to advancing the frontiers of knowledge in areas like evolutionary algorithms, neural networks, and the principles of natural processes that inspire 
        computational techniques.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    Our mission is to foster a deep understanding of natural computing and to develop innovative solutions that can address some of the world's most complex problems. 
    By harnessing the power of nature-inspired computing, we aim to contribute to scientific advancement and create a positive impact on society.

    Research in natural computing is at the core of our activities, covering theoretical foundations, the development of new algorithms, and interdisciplinary applications of natural computing methods. Some of our current projects, in particular, focus on the following areas:

    <ul>
        <li>Robust optimization using evolutionary algorithms</li>
        <li>Multiple criteria decision support</li>
        <li>Mixed-integer evolutionary strategies (MIES)</li>
        <li>Cellular automata for simulation applications</li>
        <li>Particle swarm algorithms</li>
        <li>Multiparameter physics applications (e.g., quantum control)</li>
        <li>Medical image analysis applications</li>
        <li>Drug design by interactive and automatic evolution</li>
        <li>Protein folding and docking applications</li>
        <li>Supply chain applications</li>
        <li>Predictive Maintenance</li>
        <li>eXplainable Artificial Intelligence</li>
    </ul>
    Beyond this, we are also executing projects in direct cooperation with industry (see collaborations for more information).

    The driving force behind our research is the mission to increase our understanding of natural systems as models of computation, with a focus on the development of new algorithms and applications to challenging problems.

    <h2>Event partnerships</h2>
    The Natural Computing Cluster is an academic partner of the <a href="https://ecta.scitevents.org/CallForPapers.aspx" target="_blank">International Conference on Evolutionary Computation Theory and Applications (ECTA)</a>. 
    This conference intends to be a major forum for scientists, engineers and practitioners interested in the study, analysis, design, modeling and implementation of evolvable systems, both theoretically and in a broad range of application fields. ECTA welcomes both theoretical research and practical applications.
The conference also aims to foster hybrid approaches within evolutionary computation and also involving fuzzy computation and neural computation.
