In the research project titled "Excellent Buildings: Realistic Geometries for optimal structural, thermal, and lighting performance", which is supported by NWO, The Netherlands, TOP Grant 18036, we are investigating the use of multi-objective optimization algorithms to improve the spatial design of buildings. Our approach in this project is innovative, as we are adopting a multi-disciplinary perspective. The multiobjective approach includes discipline such as thermal performance (energy efficiency, thermal comfort), lighting performance, and structural performance. 
To enable algorithm design, we are in the process of creating geometric data structures that can be enhanced through the utilization of optimization algorithms, while also establishing a defined range of possibilities. The innovative Prism Nets data structure has the capability to depict and represent multilevel structures with internal areas and walls. Furthermore, various algorithmic approaches grounded in this particular data structure were introduced.
The project is carried out in collaboration with researchers from the Built Environment Department at TU Eindhoven in The Netherlands.
