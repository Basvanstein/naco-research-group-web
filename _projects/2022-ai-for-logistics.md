In this research project, we aim to build innovative multi-objective optimization models and develop efficient methods, algorithms, and tools for solving multi-objective logistics problems. Based on real-world applications and challenges in last-mile logistics, we propose new models that help address these challenges and improve logistics efficiency. To solve these models, we develop algorithms and tools by incorporating existing heuristics, metaheuristics, and learning-based optimization methods. Additionally, we explore methods for efficiently solving large-scale optimization problems. Our goal is to achieve a more sustainable global logistics network.
