**Leiden, The Netherlands** – The Natural Computing research cluster of LIACS, Leiden University is proud to announce that 9 of our papers and one hot-of-the-track paper have been accepted for presentation at the <a href="https://gecco-2024.sigevo.org/HomePage" target="_blank">Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) 2024</a>.

GECCO, renowned for its rigorous selection process and esteemed reputation, is the leading conference in the field of genetic and evolutionary computation. 

### Our Accepted Contributions

Our success at GECCO 2024 represents the diverse and in-depth research conducted by our team. Here's an overview of our accepted papers:

#### 1. Bridging Functions Across Domains
**"Transfer Learning of Surrogate Models via Domain Affine Transformation"**  
_**Authors:** Shuaiqun Pan, Diederick Vermetten, Manuel López-Ibáñez, Thomas Bäck, and Hao Wang_  
This paper introduces a novel method for transferring surrogate models between different tasks, potentially revolutionizing how we approach optimization problems. It shows that with a small dataset from the target domain, the adapted model outperforms both the original surrogate and a new one built from scratch.

#### 9. Modular Framework for Multi-objective Optimization
**"Modular Optimization Framework for Mixed Expensive and Inexpensive Real-World Problems"**  
_**Authors:** Roy de Winter, Thomas Bäck and Niki van Stein_  
A modular optimization framework is proposed that can deal with different problem characteristics encountered in real-world design problems. The common denominator of problems considered in this work is the computationally demanding objective function used to evaluate the designs, while some of the constraint functions can be inexpensive.

#### 10. Hot of the Press

Hot of the press paper presentation for **"Parallel Multi-Objective Optimization for Expensive and Inexpensive Objectives and Constraints"**.  
_**Authors:** Roy de Winter, Bas Milatz, Julian Blank, Niki van Stein, Thomas Bäck, Kalyanmoy Deb_  
Expensive objectives and constraints are key characteristics of real-world multi-objective optimization problems. In practice, they often occur jointly with inexpensive objectives and constraints. This paper presents the Inexpensive Objectives and Constraints Self-Adapting Multi-Objective Constraint Optimization algorithm that uses Radial Basis function Approximations (IOC-SAMO-COBRA) for such problems.
